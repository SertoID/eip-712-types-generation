# eip-712-types-generation

This package serves to generate a Types object compatible with EIP-712 ( https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ethereum-eip712-signature-2021-spec/ )

## Usage

Import `getEthTypesFromInputDoc` into your project and pass in the `message` that you intend to sign using EIP-712, including the `proof` object. This will return an object that can be used as the `types` object passed into `eth_signTypedDatav4`

## Developing

Simply run `yarn` to initialize project, then `yarn test` to test.
